# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse-over-Paint-Application
This is a Python project for controlling a computer's mouse cursor using hand gestures. The program recognizes hand gestures through a webcam using the Mediapipe library and controls the mouse cursor via the PyAutoGUI library.

The project is divided into two files, app.py and controller.py. The app.py file contains the main program logic while controller.py is responsible for handling the mouse cursor movement and click events.

There is an extra file, requirements.txt which you can use to install the libraries required for this project.
